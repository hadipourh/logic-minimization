Logic Friday is a freeware tool for students, hobbyists, and engineers who work with legacy digital logic circuits based on standard IC packages.

Current version: 1.1.4, released 9 November, 2012.

With Logic Friday you can:

    Enter a logic function as a truth table, an equation, or a gate diagram
    Enter functions with up to 16 inputs and 16 outputs
    Minimize a function with options of fast or exact minimization
    Automatically generate a multi-level gate diagram using gates chosen from a library
    Automatically minimize the number of standard gate packages
    Trace the logic state of each gate's inputs and outputs for a given input vector
    Compare logic functions
    Generate new functions as logical combinations of others
    View any function as a truth table, equation, or gate diagram
    Generate efficient, compact C code lookup functions from logic functions
    Save functions and gate diagram images to files
    Export and import truth tables as CSV files for editing in spreadsheet applications.

Logic Friday uses espresso for minimization and misII for gate diagram synthesis.* Both programs are included with the download.
