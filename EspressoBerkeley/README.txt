Due to lack of funding, UC Berkeley no longer provides Espresso
techinical support and no further work is anticipated on the main 
body of Espresso.  

Please do not forward Espresso questions to UC Berkeley students,
faculty, or staff as there is nobody here who can answer them.

You may direct Espresso questions to the newsgroup "comp.lsi.cad".
